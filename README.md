# convo2canvas 

Convo2Canvas is a dynamic Python bot that transforms conversation inputs into unique pieces of art. 
Utilizing the GPT-3.5-turbo model, it processes text from a Discord channel, generating creative prompts which are then used to trigger a Stable Diffusion process for image generation.
